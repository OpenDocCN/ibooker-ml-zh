    fundamentally different use cases for machine learning and illustrate how MLOps
    methodology might differ to suit the needs of the business and its ML model life

    on whether or not to grant it. Depending on the case, the amount of automation
    in the process may vary. However, it is very likely that the decision will be
    informed by scores that estimate the probability that the loan will or will not
    be repaid as expected.

    the direct impact they have on the institutions’ revenues and on customers’ lives,
    these predictive models have always been under great scrutiny. Consequently, processes,

    and current situation is usually available. How much credit does the customer
    hold? Has the customer ever not repaid a loan (in credit jargon, is the customer
    a delinquent)? In some countries, organizations called credit bureaus collect
    this information and make it available to creditors either directly or through
    the form of a score (like the aforementioned FICO score).

- en: The definition of the target to be predicted is more complex. A customer not
    repaying as expected is a “bad” outcome in credit risk modeling. In theory, one
    should wait for the complete repayment to determine a “good” outcome and for the
    loss charge off to determine a “bad” outcome. However, it may take a long time
    to obtain these ultimate figures, and waiting for them would deter reactivity
    to changing conditions. As a result, trade-offs are usually made, based on various
    indicators, to declare “bad” outcomes before the losses are certain.

    requires enormous time and effort. Combined with advanced techniques like two-stage
