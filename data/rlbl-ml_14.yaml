- en: 'Integrating any significant new discipline into an organization often looks
    more like an exercise in irregular gardening than anything else: you spread the
    seeds around, regardless of whether the ground is fertile or not, and every so
    often come back to see what has managed to flourish. You might be lucky and see
    a riot of color in the spring, but without more structure and discipline, you’ll
    more likely be greeted by something barren.'

  zh: 将任何重要的新学科整合到组织中，往往看起来更像是一种不规则园艺的练习：你随意撒播种子，不管土壤是否肥沃，然后定期回来看看哪些得以茁壮生长。你可能会幸运地在春天看到五颜六色的景象，但如果缺乏更多结构和纪律，你更可能会面对一片贫瘠。
- en: Getting organizational change right is so hard for plenty of *general* reasons.
    For a start, an effectively infinite amount of material is available on how to
    change organizations and cultures. Even choosing from this plethora of options
    is daunting, never mind figuring out how best to implement whatever you settle
    on.

  zh: 由于各种*普遍*原因，正确进行组织变革是如此困难。首先，关于如何改变组织和文化的材料几乎是无穷无尽的。甚至从这些众多选择中做出决策都是一件令人望而生畏的事情，更不用说如何最好地实施所选择的方案了。
- en: In the case of ML, though, we have a few *domain-specific* reasons this is true,
    and arguably these are more relevant. As is rapidly becoming a cliché, the thing
    that is fundamentally different about ML is its tight coupling with the nature
    and expression of *data*. As a result, anywhere there is data in your organization,
    there is something potentially relevant to ML. Even trying to enumerate all the
    areas of the business that have or process data in some way helps to make this
    point—data is everywhere, and ML follows too. Thus ML is not just a mysterious,
    separate thing that can be isolated from other development activities. For ML
    to be successful, *leaders need a holistic view of what’s going on, and a way
    to influence what’s being done with it—at every level.*

  zh: 然而，在机器学习的情况下，我们有一些*领域特定*的理由证明这一点是真实的，并且可以说这些理由更为相关。正如迅速变成陈词滥调的是，机器学习在根本上与*数据*的性质和表达紧密耦合。因此，在您的组织中任何存在数据的地方，都可能与机器学习相关。即使试图列举出业务中所有涉及或处理数据的领域也有助于证明这一点——数据无处不在，而机器学习也是如此。因此，机器学习不仅仅是一种神秘的、孤立的事物，可以与其他开发活动分离开来。要使机器学习成功，*领导者需要全面了解正在发生的事情，并有影响其各个层面做法的方式。*
- en: What is particularly frustrating and counterintuitive about this situation is
    that almost every change management methodology recommends starting out small,
    in order to manage the risk of trying to do too much at one time. Though this
    is greatly sensible in most cases, and your first ad hoc experiments can generally
    be done without too much overhead, success in a small pilot guarantees nothing
    about how ML implementation on a larger scale might work well. Avoiding siloization
    is hard enough in most organizations, but is particularly crucial for ML.

    with implementation and management of *any* change project, except in cases of
    strong need. ML needs to be a little different. As per the preceding assumption,
    since doing ML well involves understanding the principles of how it works, what
    use it makes of data, what counts as data, and so on, leaders need to know this
    before the decisions they make are going to be sensible.

  zh: 一般来说，组织领导者不会深入参与*任何* 变革项目的详细实施和管理，除非在有强烈需求的情况下。机器学习需要有所不同。根据前述假设，由于良好的机器学习实施涉及理解其工作原理、数据的使用方式、什么被视为数据等原则，领导者在做出决策前需要了解这些内容才能做出明智的决策。
- en: Our main observation here is that by default, leaders are not going to pick
    up ML-relevant knowledge as part of their regular management activity, and so
    there needs to be an explicit mechanism for doing so. This is in opposition to
    the bulk of conventional managerial theory, which asserts that most teams can
    be managed effectively with a handful of representative KPIs and a good understanding
    of team dynamics. We currently believe that ML is sufficiently complex, new, and
    potentially impactful that being aware of the details matters—though we expect
    this will change as time goes on.^([1](ch13.xhtml#ch01fn139)) For the moment,
    though, leaders need to understand ML basics and be able to access practitioners,
    which in turn will help them assess the likelihood of success, and make outcomes
    better.

  zh: 我们的主要观察是，默认情况下，领导者不会在他们的日常管理活动中获取与机器学习相关的知识，因此需要有一个明确的机制来实现这一点。这与大部分传统管理理论相反，后者认为大多数团队可以通过少量代表性关键绩效指标和对团队动态的深刻理解来有效管理。目前我们认为机器学习足够复杂、新颖且具有潜在影响力，因此了解其细节至关重要——尽管随着时间的推移我们预计这种情况会发生改变。（[1](ch13.xhtml#ch01fn139)）然而，目前领导者需要了解机器学习的基础知识，并能接触从业者，这反过来将帮助他们评估成功的可能性，并使结果更好。
- en: Outside of training programs, our main recommendation to achieve this level
    of understanding is that ML should not be siloed, either as a standalone technology-driven
    effort, or in any other way. Given it can touch everything, a strong siloization
    would invert the flow of information and control, and could introduce big risk
    management problems. ML is naturally a horizontal activity.

- en: An ML developer at YarnIt wants to make a business impact, specifically on the
    web sales part of the business. They work to build a model identifying products
    that are underperforming in terms of sales. The model recommends these products
    in particular contexts in order to increase their sales. A model like this might
    be successful in a variety of ways. It might identify new purchasers for these
    products or simply remind people who used to purchase these products that they
    might want to purchase them again.

  zh: YarnIt的一位机器学习开发人员希望在业务销售部分产生业务影响。他们致力于建立一个模型，识别在销售方面表现不佳的产品。该模型在特定情境中推荐这些产品，以增加它们的销售。这样的模型可能会以多种方式取得成功。它可能会为这些产品识别新的购买者，或者只是提醒曾经购买这些产品的人可能再次购买它们。
- en: 'But now there’s a problem in our case: it manages to find cashmere wool yarn,
    a prestige item that YarnIt has in very low supply. Since this model does not
    have features for (can’t effectively represent or understand) margin or inventory,
    it manages to sell all of it. Cashmere yarn is in short supply in the industry,
    and replacing it will take weeks, or even months. Although very few customers
    purchase this yarn in large quantities, many of them may buy a little bit from
    time to time as part of larger orders. Another effect that you sometimes see in
    ecommerce is that when a web shop doesn’t have a particular thing in stock, customers
    sometimes take their whole order elsewhere—and YarnIt experiences this too. So
    now YarnIt is losing sales on *other* products because of their lack of stock

    most out of the *yarnit.ai* site and help YarnIt make the most money from customers.
    Among the features that the models use is information about the browser the customers

    a better sense of what browser configurations customers are using. To get all
    of the information required, the team decides, *without* talking to the ML folks,

- en: The problem is that the full contents of the `User-Agent` plus location information
    (that the model also has) often uniquely identify a single person. So now we have
    a model that has the ability to target individual people. This violates some privacy

- en: In both of these cases, the individual teams did nothing wrong *in their context*.
    But acting on incomplete information about the effect of their choices on other

    For example, perhaps the audience believes there’s nothing real to be gained by
    spending the effort to make the data of their teams readable by others; or perhaps
    they’re scared by the prospect of being shown to be worse than other teams; or
    perhaps they profoundly believe that the only thing that matters is getting product

    the only organizational culture that experiences *structural* problems when implementing

    organizations tend to crush novelty, and as a result are much less likely to implement
    ML on their own in any serious way. On the other hand, *performance-oriented*
    cultures have an openness to novelty, cooperation, communication, and risk sharing.

    when it goes wrong. Failure leads to negative consequences for those seen to have
    failed, organizations have narrow (and thoroughly defended) responsibilities,

    able to gain a foothold, but when anything goes wrong or becomes difficult, those
    “at fault” will be punished and the innovation will promptly cease. Unfortunately,
    such behavior makes it very hard to adequately model and respond to the cross-cutting
