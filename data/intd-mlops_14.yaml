    will walk through a machine learning model life cycle and MLOps use case for consumption
    forecasting, including business considerations, data collection, and implementation
    decisions. Though this particular chapter is focused on power grids, the considerations
    and particularities of the use case can be generalized to other industrial cases

- en: Once the data preparation has been finished, the data scientist typically has
    access to a few hundred time series of production and consumption at various withdrawal
    points of the grid. They have to develop methods to predict some of them at various
    horizons. Their focus is usually on wind, PV, and sometimes run-of-the river hydroelectricity
    production potential and on demand. While wind and PV mainly depend on meteorological
    factors, the demand is mainly driven by economic activity, but part of it is also
    dependent on meteorology (for example heating and cooling).

    the mid-term forecast from the recent historical data and use standard time series
    techniques, such as ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) or exponential

    not on meteorological forecasts. As a result, it gives too much importance to
