- en: 'I vividly remember my first undergraduate class in artificial intelligence
    (AI). My father had worked for years on “expert systems,” and I was at MIT to
    learn from the best how to perform this wizardry. Marvin Minsky, one of the founders
    of the field, even taught a series of guest lectures there. It was about midway
    through the semester when the great disillusionment hit me: “It’s all just a bunch
    of tricks!” There was no “intelligence” to be found; just a bunch of brittle rules
    engines and clever use of math. This was in the early ’90s and the start of my
    own personal AI winter, when I dismissed AI as not having much use.'

  zh: 我清楚地记得我在大学本科时的第一堂人工智能课程。我父亲多年来一直从事“专家系统”的工作，而我在MIT学习如何从最好的人那里学习这种魔术。马文·明斯基，该领域的创始人之一，甚至在那里开设了一系列客座讲座。大约在学期中期时，我深深感到失望：“这只是一堆技巧！”找不到任何“智能”，只有一堆脆弱的规则引擎和巧妙的数学运用。那是在90年代初，也是我个人的人工智能寒冬的开始，我当时认为人工智能没有什么用处。
- en: Years later, while I was working on advertising systems, I finally saw that
    there was power in this “bunch of tricks.” Algorithms that had been hand-tuned
    for months by talented engineers were being beaten by simple models provided with
    lots of data. I saw that the explosion that was to come simply needed more data
    and more computation to be effective. Over the past 5 to 10 years, the explosion
    in both big data and computation power has unleashed an industry that has had
    lots of starts and stops to it.

  zh: 几年后，当我在广告系统上工作时，我终于看到了这些“一堆技巧”中的力量。经过有天赋的工程师们手工调校了几个月的算法，却被简单模型在大量数据支持下击败。我看到即将到来的爆发只需要更多的数据和计算能力才能发挥效果。在过去的5到10年中，大数据和计算能力的爆发释放出了一个行业，这个行业起起落落。
- en: This time is different. While the hype about AI is still tremendously high,
    the potential applications of practical AI have really just begun to hit the business
    world. The rules or people making predictions today will be replaced virtually
    every place by AI algorithms. The value AI creates for businesses is tremendous,
    from being better able to value the oil available in an oil field to better predicting
    the inventory a store should stock of each new sneaker. Even marginal improvements
    in these capabilities represent billions of dollars of value across businesses.

  zh: 这一次确实不同。尽管人工智能的炒作依然极高，但实际人工智能的潜在应用才刚刚开始影响商业世界。今天做出预测的规则或人将几乎被人工智能算法取代。人工智能为企业创造的价值是巨大的，从更好地评估油田中的石油价值到更好地预测每款新运动鞋的库存量。即使在这些能力上稍微提升，也代表着跨企业数十亿美元的价值。
- en: We’re now in an age of AI implementation. Companies are working to find all
    the best places to deploy AI in their enterprises. One of the biggest challenges
    is matching the hype to reality. Half the companies I’ve talked to expect AI to
    perform some kind of magic for problems they have no idea how to solve. The other
    half are underestimating the power that AI can have. What they need are people
    with enough background in AI to help them conceive of what is possible and apply
    it to their business problems.

  zh: 我们现在处于人工智能实施的时代。企业正在努力找出在其企业中部署人工智能的最佳位置。其中最大的挑战之一是将炒作与现实相匹配。我与的公司中有一半期望人工智能能够解决一些他们根本不知道如何解决的问题。另一半则低估了人工智能可能具有的力量。他们需要具备足够人工智能背景的人来帮助他们构思可能性，并将其应用到他们的业务问题中。
- en: Customers I talk to are struggling to find enough people with those skills.
    While they have lots of developers and data analysts who are skilled and comfortable
    making predictions and decisions with data, they need data scientists who can
    then build the model from that data. This book will help fill that gap.

  zh: 我与的客户们正在努力寻找具备这些技能的人才。虽然他们有许多熟练并习惯于利用数据进行预测和决策的开发人员和数据分析师，但他们需要能够从这些数据中构建模型的数据科学家。本书将帮助填补这一空白。
- en: It shows how automated ML can empower developers and data analysts to train
    AI models. It highlights a number of business cases where AI is a great fit to
    the business problem and show exactly how to build that model and put it into
    production. The technology and ideas in this book have been pressure-tested at
    scale with teams all across Microsoft, including Bing, Office, Azure Security,
    internal IT, and many more. It’s also been used by many external businesses using
    Azure Machine Learning.
