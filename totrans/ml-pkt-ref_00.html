<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>Machine learning and data science are very popular right now and&#13;
are fast-moving targets. I have worked with Python and data for&#13;
most of my career and wanted to have a physical book that&#13;
could provide a reference for the common methods that I have&#13;
been using in industry and teaching during workshops to solve&#13;
structured machine learning problems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book is what I believe is the best collection of resources&#13;
and examples for attacking a predictive modeling task if you&#13;
have structured data. There are many libraries that perform a&#13;
portion of the tasks required and I have tried to incorporate&#13;
those that I have found useful as I have applied these techniques&#13;
in consulting or industry work.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Many may lament the lack of deep learning techniques. Those&#13;
could be a book by themselves. I also prefer simpler techniques&#13;
and others in industry seem to agree. Deep learning for unstructured&#13;
data (video, audio, images), and powerful tools like XGBoost for&#13;
structured data.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I hope this book serves as a useful reference for you to solve&#13;
pressing problems.</p>&#13;
&#13;

<h1>What to Expect</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book gives in-depth examples of solving common structured data&#13;
problems. It walks through various libraries and models, their&#13;
trade-offs, how to tune them, and how to interpret them.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The code snippets are meant to be sized such that you can use&#13;
and adapt them in your own projects.</p>&#13;

<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you are just learning machine learning, or have worked with&#13;
it for years, this book should serve as a valuable reference. It assumes&#13;
some knowledge of Python, and doesn’t delve at all into syntax.&#13;
Rather it shows how to use various libraries to solve real-world&#13;
problems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This will not replace an in-depth course, but should serve as a&#13;
reference of what an applied machine learning course might cover.&#13;
(Note: The author uses it as a reference for the data analytics&#13;
and machine learning courses he teaches.)</p>&#13;

<!--PROD: Please reach out to author to find out if they will be uploading code examples to oreilly.com or their own site (e.g., GitHub). If there is no code download, delete this whole section. If there is, when you email digidist with the link, let them know what you filled in for title_title (should be as close to book title as possible, i.e., learning_python_2e). This info will determine where digidist loads the files.-->&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Much thanks to my wife and family for their support. I’m grateful to the Python community&#13;
for providing a wonderful language and toolset to work with. Nicole Tache has been lovely to work with and provided excellent feedback. My technical reviewers, Mikio Braun, Natalino Busa, and Justin Francis, kept me honest. Thanks!</p>&#13;
