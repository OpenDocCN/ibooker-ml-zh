    Chapter 5 covers the benefits of selecting proper metrics and losses for your
    ML system, defining and utilizing proxy metrics, and applying the hierarchy of
    metrics. Chapter 6 is dedicated to datasets, from choosing optimal data sources
    and processing raw data to defining properties of a healthy data pipeline and
    deciding how much data is enough for the best performance of the ML model. Chapter
    7 reviews standard and nontrivial validation schemas, describes the split updating
    procedure, and overviews validation schemas as part of the design document. In
    chapter 8, you will learn more about various types of baselines, starting from
    constant baselines as the earliest, simplest yet highly efficient version of a
    model, to model baselines, feature baselines, and deep learning baselines.
