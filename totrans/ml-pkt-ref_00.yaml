- en: Machine learning and data science are very popular right now and are fast-moving
    targets. I have worked with Python and data for most of my career and wanted to
    have a physical book that could provide a reference for the common methods that
    I have been using in industry and teaching during workshops to solve structured
    machine learning problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is what I believe is the best collection of resources and examples
    for attacking a predictive modeling task if you have structured data. There are
    many libraries that perform a portion of the tasks required and I have tried to
    incorporate those that I have found useful as I have applied these techniques
    in consulting or industry work.

- en: Many may lament the lack of deep learning techniques. Those could be a book
    by themselves. I also prefer simpler techniques and others in industry seem to
    agree. Deep learning for unstructured data (video, audio, images), and powerful
    tools like XGBoost for structured data.

    It walks through various libraries and models, their trade-offs, how to tune them,
    and how to interpret them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are just learning machine learning, or have worked with it for years,
    this book should serve as a valuable reference. It assumes some knowledge of Python,
    and doesn’t delve at all into syntax. Rather it shows how to use various libraries
    to solve real-world problems.

    community for providing a wonderful language and toolset to work with. Nicole
    Tache has been lovely to work with and provided excellent feedback. My technical
    reviewers, Mikio Braun, Natalino Busa, and Justin Francis, kept me honest. Thanks!
