- en: Part 3 is focused on intermediate steps. Chapter 9 overviews the learning curve
    analysis, provides a closer look at the residual analysis, and helps in finding
    commonalities in residuals. Chapter 10 is dedicated to training pipelines, covers
    tools and platforms we can use to build and maintain training pipelines, and presents
    such topics as scalability and configurability of training pipelines. Chapter
    11 addresses features and feature engineering, analyzes features, gives hints
    on selecting appropriate features for the ML model, and lists pros and cons of
    feature stores. In chapter 12, we give an overview on measuring and reporting
    results and discuss the benefits of conducting A/B tests.
