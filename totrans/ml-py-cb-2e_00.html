<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>When the first edition of this book was published in 2018, it filled a critical gap in the growing wealth of machine learning (ML) content. By providing well-tested, hands-on Python recipes, it enabled practitioners to copy and paste code before easily adapting it to their use cases. In a short five years, the ML space has continued to explode with advances in deep learning (DL) and the associated DL Python frameworks.</p>
<p>Now, in 2023, there is a need for the same sort of hands-on content that serves the needs of both ML <em>and</em> DL practitioners with the latest Python libraries. This book intends to build on the existing (and fantastic) work done by the author of the first edition by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updating existing examples to use the latest Python versions and frameworks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporating modern practices in data sources, data analysis, ML, and DL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expanding the DL content to include tensors, neural networks, and DL for text and vision in PyTorch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking our models one step further by serving them in an API</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like the first edition, this book takes a task-based approach to machine learning, boasting over 200 self-contained solutions (copy, paste, and run) for the most common tasks a data scientist or machine learning engineer building a model will run into.</p>

<h1>Using Code Examples</h1>
<!--PROD: Please reach out to author to find out if they will be uploading code examples to oreilly.com or their own site (e.g., GitHub). If there is no code download, delete this whole section. If there is, when you email digidist with the link, let them know what you filled in for title_title (should be as close to book title as possible, i.e., learning_python_2e). This info will determine where digidist loads the files.-->
<p>This <a data-primary="GitHub" data-type="indexterm" id="id870"/>book is accompanied by a <a href="https://oreil.ly/MLwPython">GitHub repository</a> that has instructions for running a Jupyter Notebook in a Docker container with all dependencies used in this book. By replicating the commands from this book in the notebook, you can ensure the examples in this book will be completely reproducible.</p>
<p>If you have a technical question or a problem using the code examples, please send an email to <a class="email" href="mailto:support@oreilly.com"><em>support@oreilly.com</em></a>.</p>
<p>This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if example code is offered with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or distributing examples from O’Reilly books does require permission. Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this book into your product’s documentation does require permission.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>The second edition of this book is clearly only possible because of the fantastic content, structure, and quality laid out in the first edition by the original author, Chris Albon. As the first author of the second edition, I cannot understate the degree to which this made my job way, way easier.</p>
<p class="less_space pagebreak-before">Of course, the machine learning space also evolves rapidly, and the updates included in this second edition could not have been written without the thoughtful feedback of my peers. I’d specifically like to thank my fellow Etsy coworkers Andrea Heyman, Maria Gomez, Alek Maelstrum, and Brian Schmidt for acquiescing to requests for input on various chapters and being unwillingly coaxed into sudden brainstorming sessions that shaped the new content added to this edition. I’d also like to thank the technical reviewers—Jigyasa Grover, Matteus Tanha, and Ganesh Harke—along with the O’Reilly editors: Jeff Bleiel, Nicole Butterfield, and Clare Laylock. That being said, the number of people who’ve helped me and this book get to the place it’s at (in one way or another) is massive. I’d love to thank everyone who’s been a part of my ML journey in one way or another and helped make this book what it is. Love y’all.</p>
