<h1><span class="label">Part II. </span>Unsupervised Learning Using <span class="keep-together">Scikit-Learn</span></h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>In<a data-primary="unsupervised learning" data-secondary="using scikit_learn" data-type="indexterm" id="ULscikit03"/> the next few chapters, we will introduce two major unsupervised learning concepts—dimensionality reduction and clustering—and use these to perform anomaly detection and group segmentation.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Both anomaly detection and group segmentation have significant real-world applications across many different industries.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Anomaly detection<a data-primary="anomaly detection" data-secondary="applications for" data-type="indexterm" id="idm140637553308064"/> is used to efficiently discover rare events such as fraud; <span class="keep-together">cybersecurity</span> breaches; terrorism; human, arms, and drug trafficking; money laundering; abnormal trading activity; disease outbreaks; and  maintenance failures in mission-critical equipment.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Group segmentation<a data-primary="group segmentation" data-secondary="applications for" data-type="indexterm" id="idm140637553305664"/> allows us to understand user behavior in areas such as marketing, online shopping, music listening, video watching, online dating, and social media activity, among others.</p>&#13;
