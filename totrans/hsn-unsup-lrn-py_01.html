<h1><span class="label">Part I. </span>Fundamentals of Unsupervised Learning</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>To start, letâ€™s<a data-primary="unsupervised learning" data-secondary="fundamentals of" data-type="indexterm" id="ULfund01a"/> explore the current machine learning ecosystem and where unsupervised learning fits in. We will also build a machine learning project from scratch to cover basics such as setting up the programming environment, acquiring and preparing data, exploring data, selecting machine learning algorithms and cost functions, and evaluating the results.</p>&#13;
