   <p>This part is fully dedicated to the early stages of machine learning system design. Chapter 1 introduces our vision of machine learning system (ML) design and highlights the areas where its principles can be useful. Chapter 2 thoroughly describes the problem space and solution space and the absolute priority the former has over the latter, as well as provides insights on defining the problem, risks, limitations, and costs of a mistake. Chapter 3 unveils the build-or-buy dilemma, looks at the problem as a source of inspiration, and suggests our view on problem decompositioning. Chapter 4 is dedicated to the design document as the essential building block of any ML system.</p>
