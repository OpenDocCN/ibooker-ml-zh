- en: This part is fully dedicated to the early stages of machine learning system
    design. Chapter 1 introduces our vision of machine learning system (ML) design
    and highlights the areas where its principles can be useful. Chapter 2 thoroughly
    describes the problem space and solution space and the absolute priority the former
    has over the latter, as well as provides insights on defining the problem, risks,
    limitations, and costs of a mistake. Chapter 3 unveils the build-or-buy dilemma,
    looks at the problem as a source of inspiration, and suggests our view on problem
    decompositioning. Chapter 4 is dedicated to the design document as the essential
    building block of any ML system.
