- en: Until now, we have worked with only shallow neural networks; in other words,
    networks with only a few hidden layers. Shallow neural networks are certainly
    useful in building machine learning systems, but the most powerful advances in
    machine learning over the past decade have come from neural networks with many
    hidden layers, known as *deep neural networks*. This subfield of machine learning
    is known as *deep learning*. Deep learning on large, labeled datasets has led
    to major commercial successes in areas such as computer vision, object recognition,
    speech recognition, and machine translation.

    referred to as *deep unsupervised learning*. This field is still very new, full
    of potential but with fewer commerical successes to date compared to the supervised
    variant. Over the next few chapters, we will build deep unsupervised learning
    systems, starting with the simplest building blocks.

    we will use to build a recommender system for movies. In [Chapter 11](ch11.html#Chapter_11),
    we will stack restricted Boltzmann machines on top of each other, creating deep
    neural nets known as deep belief networks. In [Chapter 12](ch12.html#Chapter_12),
    we will generate synthetic data using generative adversarial networks, one of
    the hottest areas of deep unsupervised learning today. Then in [Chapter 13](ch13.html#Chapter_13),
    we will return to clustering but work with time series data this time.'

    draws on the fundamental principles we introduced earlier in the book.
