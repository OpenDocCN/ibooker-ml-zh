- en: Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) in which computers
    learn from data—usually to improve their performance on some narrowly defined
    task—without being explicitly programmed. The term *machine learning* was coined
    as early as 1959 (by Arthur Samuel, a legend in the field of AI), but there were
    few major commercial successes in machine learning during the twenty-first century.
    Instead, the field remained a niche research area for academics at universities.

- en: Early on (in the 1960s) many in the AI community were too optimistic about its
    future. Researchers at the time, such as Herbert Simon and Marvin Minsky, claimed
    that AI would reach human-level intelligence within a matter of decades:^([1](preface01.html#idm140637565202624))

- en: Blinded by their optimism, researchers focused on so-called *strong AI* or *general
    artificial intelligence (AGI)* projects, attempting to build AI agents capable
    of problem solving, knowledge representation, learning and planning, natural language
    processing, perception, and motor control. This optimism helped attract significant
    funding into the nascent field from major players such as the Department of Defense,
    but the problems these researchers tackled were too ambitious and ultimately doomed
    to fail.

- en: AI research rarely made the leap from academia to industry, and a series of
    so-called AI winters followed. In these AI winters (an analogy based on the nuclear
    winter during this Cold War era), interest in and funding for AI dwindled. Occasionally,
    hype cycles around AI occurred but had very little staying power. By the early
    1990s, interest in and funding for AI had hit a trough.

    learning algorithms, the availability of lots of data, and superfast computers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, instead of focusing on overly ambitious strong AI projects, researchers
    turned their attention to narrowly defined subproblems of strong AI, also known
    as *weak AI* or *narrow AI*. This focus on improving solutions for narrowly defined
    tasks led to algorithmic breakthroughs, which paved the way for successful commercial
    applications. Many of these algorithms—often developed initially at universities
    or private research labs—were quickly open-sourced, speeding up the adoption of
    these technologies by industry.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, data capture became a focus for most organizations, and the costs of
    storing data fell dramatically driven by advances in digital data storage. Thanks
    to the internet, lots of data also became widely and publicly available at a scale
    never before seen.

    strong AI will surpass human intelligence and reach so-called *superintelligence*.
    Estimates for attaining such superintelligence range from as little as 15 years

    enough to achieve this in a few generations. Is this inflated hype once again

    involved supervised learning, taking advantage of labeled datasets. However, most
    of the world’s data is *unlabeled*.

    LeCun, the Director of AI Research at Facebook and a professor at NYU, unsupervised
    learning is the next frontier in AI and may hold the key to AGI. For this and
    many other reasons, unsupervised learning is one of the trendiest topics in AI
