   <p>This is the final part of the book, dedicated to integration and growth. Chapter 13 covers integration, from API design and release cycle to operating the system and turning to fallbacks in case of malfunctioning. In chapter 14, we discuss monitoring and reliability, software system health, data quality and integrity, and model quality and relevance. Chapter 15 overviews serving and inference optimization, the challenges that may arise during the serving and inference stage, preferred tools and frameworks, and such topics as optimizing inference pipelines. Finally, chapter 16 reviews ownership and maintenance, accountability as one of the key factors in having a healthy ML system, tradeoffs between teams’ efficiency and redundancy, the fundamental importance of properly arranged documentation, and the deceptive appeal of complexity.</p>
