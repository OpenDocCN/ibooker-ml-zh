    hoping to suggest just the right thing based on users’ quirky preferences across
    a vast sea of choices? If so, you’ve set quite the challenge for yourself! On
    the surface, these systems might seem straightforward: if User A and User B have
    similar tastes, then maybe what A likes, B will too. But, as with all things that
    seem simple, there’s a depth that’s waiting to be explored.'

- en: How do we capture the essence of a user’s history and feed it into a model?
    Where do we stash this model so it’s ready to serve up suggestions on the fly?
    And how do we make sure it doesn’t suggest something that steps out of bounds
    or goes against the business rulebook? Collaborative filtering is our starting
    point, a guiding light. But there’s an entire universe beyond it that makes these
    systems tick, and together, we’re going to navigate it.
