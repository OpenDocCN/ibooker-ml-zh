- en: We just concluded the Scikit-Learn-based unsupervised learning portion of the
    book. Now we will move to neural network-based unsupervised learning. In the next
    few chapters, we will introduce neural networks, including the popular frameworks
    used to apply them, TensorFlow and Keras.

- en: In [Chapter 7](ch07.html#Chapter_7), we will use an autoencoder—a shallow neural
    network—to automatically perform feature engineering and feature selection. Moving
    on from there, in [Chapter 8](ch08.html#Chapter_8), we will apply autoencoders
    to a real-world problem. Following that, [Chapter 9](ch09.html#Chapter_9) explores
    how to turn unsupervised learning problems into semisupervised ones, leveraging
    the few labels we have to improve the precision and recall of a purely unsupervised
    model.

    neural networks in the last portion of the book.
