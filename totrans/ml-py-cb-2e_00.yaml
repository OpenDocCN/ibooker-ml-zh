- en: When the first edition of this book was published in 2018, it filled a critical
    gap in the growing wealth of machine learning (ML) content. By providing well-tested,
    hands-on Python recipes, it enabled practitioners to copy and paste code before
    easily adapting it to their use cases. In a short five years, the ML space has
    continued to explode with advances in deep learning (DL) and the associated DL
    Python frameworks.

- en: 'Now, in 2023, there is a need for the same sort of hands-on content that serves
    the needs of both ML *and* DL practitioners with the latest Python libraries.
    This book intends to build on the existing (and fantastic) work done by the author
    of the first edition by:'

    run into.

- en: The second edition of this book is clearly only possible because of the fantastic
    content, structure, and quality laid out in the first edition by the original
    author, Chris Albon. As the first author of the second edition, I cannot understate
    the degree to which this made my job way, way easier.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Of course, the machine learning space also evolves rapidly, and the updates
    included in this second edition could not have been written without the thoughtful
    feedback of my peers. I’d specifically like to thank my fellow Etsy coworkers
    Andrea Heyman, Maria Gomez, Alek Maelstrum, and Brian Schmidt for acquiescing
    to requests for input on various chapters and being unwillingly coaxed into sudden
    brainstorming sessions that shaped the new content added to this edition. I’d
    also like to thank the technical reviewers—Jigyasa Grover, Matteus Tanha, and
    Ganesh Harke—along with the O’Reilly editors: Jeff Bleiel, Nicole Butterfield,
    and Clare Laylock. That being said, the number of people who’ve helped me and
    this book get to the place it’s at (in one way or another) is massive. I’d love
    to thank everyone who’s been a part of my ML journey in one way or another and
    helped make this book what it is. Love y’all.'
