&#13;
&#13;
<p>We just concluded the Scikit-Learn-based unsupervised learning portion of the book. Now we will move to neural network-based unsupervised learning. In the next few chapters, we will introduce neural networks, including the popular frameworks used to apply them, TensorFlow and Keras.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#Chapter_7">Chapter 7</a>, we will use an autoencoder—a shallow neural network—to automatically perform feature engineering and feature selection. Moving on from there, in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#Chapter_8">Chapter 8</a>, we will apply autoencoders to a real-world problem. Following that, <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#Chapter_9">Chapter 9</a> explores how to turn unsupervised learning problems into semisupervised ones, leveraging the few labels we have to improve the precision and recall of a purely unsupervised model.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once we are finished reviewing shallow neural networks, we will look at deep neural networks in the last portion of the book.</p>&#13;
