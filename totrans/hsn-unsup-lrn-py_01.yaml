- en: To start, letâ€™s explore the current machine learning ecosystem and where unsupervised
    learning fits in. We will also build a machine learning project from scratch to
    cover basics such as setting up the programming environment, acquiring and preparing
    data, exploring data, selecting machine learning algorithms and cost functions,
    and evaluating the results.
