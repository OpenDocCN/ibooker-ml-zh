    knowing the concepts you’ll see at next year’s conferences. These ideas are already
    proven to some extent—none of them are pure science fiction—but they haven’t settled
    into their final forms yet.

- en: Before we get into these few very modern ideas, it’s also worth noting all the
    topics we haven’t covered in this book. Our most heinous omissions are probably
    reinforcement learning techniques and ideas related to conformal methods. Both
    are deeply important aspects of recommendation systems, but both also require
    a significantly different background and treatment, and thus are ill-suited to
    fit into the structure here. Additionally, neither is well introduced to the JAX
    ecosystem, and thus they are a much harder lift to scaffold.

    your toast, the following chapters will show you how to level up. At the time
    of writing, all these methods are in production at Fortune 500 companies valued
    at more than $10 billion. Learn these concepts and then go build the next TikTok.
