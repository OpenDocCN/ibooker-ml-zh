    for machine learning. It was created by the author as an additional resource during
    training, meant to be distributed as a physical notebook. Participants (who favor
    the physical characteristics of dead-tree material) could add their own notes
    and thoughts and have a valuable reference of curated examples.

    learning applications include predicting a continuous value (regression), creating
    clusters, or trying to reduce dimensionality, among others. This book does not
    discuss deep learning techniques. While those techniques work well for unstructured
    data, most recommend the techniques in this book for structured data.

- en: We assume knowledge and familiarity with Python. Learning how to manipulate
    data using the [pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org) is useful. We have
    many examples using pandas, and it is an excellent tool for dealing with structured
    data. However, some of the indexing operations may be confusing if you are not
    familiar with numpy. Full coverage of pandas could be a book in itself.

- en: This book uses many libraries. This can be a good thing and a bad thing. Some
    of these libraries may be hard to install or conflict with other library versions.
    Do not feel like you need to install all of these libraries. Use “JIT installation”
    and only install the libraries that you want to use as you need them.

    I need to use `pip install` `--no-deps fastai`. The `umap` library is installed
    with `pip install umap-learn`. The `janitor` library is installed with `pip install
    pyjanitor`. The `autosklearn` library is installed with `pip install auto-sklearn`.

    as well. Note that some, like Google Colab, have preinstalled many of the libraries
    (though they may be outdated versions).

    `pip` (an acronym for Pip Installs Python), a tool that comes with Python. The
    other option is to use [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org). We will introduce both.

    doesn’t recognize that from the command prompt, you may need to reinstall or fix
    your install and make sure you check the “Add Python to my PATH” checkbox.

- en: Then you activate the environment so that when you install libraries, they go
    in the sandbox environment and not in the global Python installation. As many
    of these libraries change and are updated, it is best to lock down versions on
    a per-project basis so you know that your code will run.

    conda environment (no need to create a new virtual environment), and install these
    using `pip`.
