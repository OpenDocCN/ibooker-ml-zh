- en: This is the final part of the book, dedicated to integration and growth. Chapter
    13 covers integration, from API design and release cycle to operating the system
    and turning to fallbacks in case of malfunctioning. In chapter 14, we discuss
    monitoring and reliability, software system health, data quality and integrity,
    and model quality and relevance. Chapter 15 overviews serving and inference optimization,
    the challenges that may arise during the serving and inference stage, preferred
    tools and frameworks, and such topics as optimizing inference pipelines. Finally,
    chapter 16 reviews ownership and maintenance, accountability as one of the key
    factors in having a healthy ML system, tradeoffs between teams’ efficiency and
    redundancy, the fundamental importance of properly arranged documentation, and
    the deceptive appeal of complexity.
